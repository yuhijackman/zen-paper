      <h1>Foreword</h1>

      <p>
        This slim volume, the first of a series, is for professional
        programmers–that breed of software developers with a deep and geeky
        interest in their craft and in improving their work in small ways with
        big payoffs. The author, Kent Beck, is just such a dedicated
        professional, ever attentive to detail and ever in tune with the larger
        issues and the bigger picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Practicing software developers often pay scant attention to theory, but
        Kent knows what he is talking about when he mixes practice and theory
        into a guide to tidy code that is both readable and practical.
      </p>

      <p>
        In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice, while in
        practice there is. Various versions of this pithy pronouncement have
        been widely and incorrectly attributed to Albert Einstein and Yogi
        Berra, among others. Only a nerdy wordsmith (guilty as charged!) would
        care that the correct attribution is to Benjamin Brewster, a student at
        Yale writing in an 1882 edition of the <em>Yale Literary Magazine</em>.
        Thanks to the dedicated word geeks at QuoteInvestigator.com, I can offer
        this bit of geeky detail confident of the audience here: this is a
        profession that hinges on getting the details right.
      </p>

      <p>
        In bringing theory and practice together, Kent starts at the bottom,
        with tiny snippets of code and meticulous attention to small details,
        then works his way up to the larger view that explains the process of
        creating cleaner code that is more robust in the face of inevitable
        changes and corrections. In assembling this guide to practice, Kent
        ultimately draws on the real-world economics of software development
        along with core theory in software engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        That core theory is simply this: that the complexity of computer code
        depends on how it is organized into parts, on how coupled those parts
        are with each other and on how cohesive the parts are in themselves. The
        source of the theory of coupling and cohesion is usually attributed to
        my book with Ed Yourdon, <em>Structured Design</em> (Yourdon Press,
        1975; Prentice Hall, 1979), although it can be traced all the way back
        to a 1968 conference presentation in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Coupling
        and cohesion almost didn’t make it into the 1979 Prentice Hall edition.
        The editors tried to convince Ed and I to omit the two chapters because
        “no one is interested in theory.” Fortunately for the history of
        software engineering, the authors prevailed and the editors were proved
        wrong. The theory has since been validated through a half century of
        practice and literally hundreds of research studies and investigations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coupling and cohesion are simply measures of the complexity of computer
        code, not from the perspective of the computers executing the programs
        but that of human beings trying to understand the code. To understand
        any program, whether to create it or to correct it or to change it,
        requires understanding the piece of code immediately in front of you as
        well as those other pieces to which it is connected, which it depends on
        or affects or is affected by. It is easier to understand the immediate
        piece of code if it all hangs together, if it makes sense as a whole, if
        it forms what cognitive psychologists call a gestalt. That’s cohesion.
        It is also easier to understand it in terms of its relationships with
        other pieces of code if these relationships are few and relatively weak
        or highly constrained. That’s coupling. Coupling and cohesion are really
        all about how your brain deals with complicated systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        See? Nice and tidy. That’s the theory. Now on to the practical details
        and the mix with just enough theory to make sense of it all. Kent Beck
        will ably guide you on the way.
